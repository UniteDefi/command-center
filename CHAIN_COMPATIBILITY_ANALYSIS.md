# Cross-Chain HTLC Compatibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the compatibility of various blockchain networks with the UniteDefi HTLC-based cross-chain swap protocol. Each chain is evaluated for its ability to support the core requirements: smart contracts, hash functions, time-based operations, deterministic addresses, and event monitoring.

### Compatibility Tiers
- **Tier 1 (Full Compatibility)**: Direct implementation possible
- **Tier 2 (Adapter Required)**: Needs wrapper/adapter contracts
- **Tier 3 (Major Modifications)**: Requires significant protocol changes
- **Tier 4 (Not Recommended)**: Fundamental incompatibilities

## Core Requirements for HTLC Implementation

1. **Smart Contract Support**: Ability to deploy and execute programmable contracts
2. **Hash Functions**: Support for keccak256 or compatible hash function
3. **Time-Based Logic**: Block timestamps or block numbers for timeouts
4. **Deterministic Addresses**: CREATE2 or equivalent for pre-computing addresses
5. **Event System**: Ability to emit and monitor events
6. **Atomic Operations**: Transaction atomicity guarantees

3. **Don't underestimate** non-EVM development time

## Conclusion

The UniteDefi HTLC protocol can be implemented across most target chains with varying levels of modification. EVM-compatible chains offer the path of least resistance, while Bitcoin-family chains require the most creative solutions. The key to successful multi-chain deployment is to:

1. Start with easy wins (EVM chains)
2. Invest in high-value adaptations (Aptos, Sui)
3. Develop reusable patterns for each paradigm
4. Partner where specialized expertise is needed
5. Monitor evolving capabilities (XRP Hooks, Bitcoin L2s)

By following this tiered approach, UniteDefi can achieve broad cross-chain coverage while managing technical complexity and development resources effectively.
