# Phase 1: Test Suite Implementation Prompts

## General Instructions

- Create a git worktree to avoid conflicts with other sessions
- Work in the `resolver-branches/[chain-name]` directory
- Use the following setup commands:
  ```bash
  # From the project root (NOT from resolver/)
  mkdir -p resolver-branches
  cd resolver
  git worktree add ../resolver-branches/[chain-name] -b [chain-name]-integration
  cd ../resolver-branches/[chain-name]
  ```
- All work happens in your worktree directory
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages for each small feature
- DO NOT mock any implementations or take shortcuts or simulations of the logic
- DO NOT assume functionality that doesn't exist
- If you encounter blockers, document them in `BLOCKERS_[CHAIN_NAME].md` in your worktree
- Test must demonstrate the complete HTLC flow between your chain and Base Sepolia
- For understanding the logic, read `../../command-center/CROSS_CHAIN_RESOLUTION_PROCESS.md`
- For understanding the compatiblity of the chain you are working on, read `../../command-center/CHAIN_COMPATIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md`
- For reference code on how the logic is implemented for EVM <> EVM, check out `../../cross-chain-resolver-example/contracts` and the test suite at `../../cross-chain-resolver-example/tests`

## Cross-Chain Trade Flow Overview

The UniteDefi protocol implements a gasless, user-friendly cross-chain swap mechanism:

1. **User Pre-Approval**: Users pre-approve the escrow factory for spending their tokens (one-time setup)
2. **Gasless Trade Initiation**: User signs a gasless message with trade details and hash(secret)
3. **Relayer Service**: Posts the trade on-chain as a Dutch auction (no escrow created yet)
4. **Resolver Competition**: Resolvers monitor price drops and compete to fill orders
5. **Escrow Creation**: Winning resolver creates escrows with safety deposits on BOTH chains
6. **Asset Settlement**: Relayer moves user funds to escrow, resolver deposits on destination
7. **Secret Reveal**: After confirmations, relayer reveals secret to unlock funds
8. **Completion**: Resolver reads revealed secret and claims funds on source chain

### Detailed Flow Example
User wants to swap 50 USDT (Base Sepolia) â†’ 50 DAI (Arbitrum Sepolia):
1. User signs gasless request with trade details + hash(secret)
2. Relayer posts Dutch auction on-chain
3. Resolver creates escrows with 0.001 ETH safety deposits on both chains
4. Relayer moves user's 50 USDT to source escrow
5. Resolver deposits 50 DAI to destination escrow
6. After confirmations, relayer reveals secret on destination chain
7. Resolver sees secret and withdraws on source chain

## Base Test Flow Requirements

Each test suite must demonstrate:

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Deploy escrow factory contracts on both chains
   - Deploy Dutch auction contract
   - Set up user token approvals

2. **Trade Initiation**:
   - Simulate relayer posting Dutch auction (without escrow creation)
   - Verify auction parameters and price decay

3. **Resolver Competition**:
   - Simulate resolver monitoring price drops
   - Winner creates escrows with safety deposits on BOTH chains
   - Verify exclusive lock (no other resolver can fill)

4. **Settlement Phase**:
   - Simulate relayer moving user funds to source escrow
   - Resolver deposits agreed tokens to destination escrow
   - Wait for block confirmations

5. **Secret Reveal**:
   - Relayer reveals secret on destination chain
   - Verify resolver can read revealed secret
   - Resolver withdraws on source chain using secret

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test resolver timeout (other resolvers can claim safety deposits)
   - Test cancellation flows
   - Test partial confirmations

## EVM-Compatible Chains

### Monad Integration

```
You are implementing the UniteDefi cross-chain HTLC test suite for Monad <> Base Sepolia.

Context:
- Monad is fully EVM-compatible

Your tasks:
1. Set up worktree as instructed above with branch: `monad-integration`
2. Add Monad testnet configuration to foundry.toml
3. Create test file: test/crosschain/MonadBaseHTLC.t.sol
4. Deploy contracts:
   - EscrowFactory on both Monad and Base Sepolia

5. Implement the complete flow test:
   - User approves EscrowFactory for token spending
   - Simulate relayer posting auction (hash of secret, trade params)
   - Resolver monitors and creates escrows with 0.001 ETH deposits
   - Simulate relayer API moving user funds to escrow
   - Resolver deposits tokens on destination
   - Relayer reveals secret after confirmations
   - Resolver claims funds using revealed secret
6. Test edge cases:
   - Resolver timeout (other resolvers claim safety deposits)
   - Cancellation before secret reveal
   - Insufficient confirmations
7. Mock the relayer service API calls in tests
8. Document RPC endpoints and faucets used

Requirements:
