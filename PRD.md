# UniteDefi - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

UniteDefi is a revolutionary chain-abstracted wallet and cross-chain swap platform that eliminates the complexity of multi-chain DeFi. Users deposit funds once and see a single USD balance, while the platform automatically handles cross-chain bridging and gas management behind the scenes. Built for the ETHGlobal Unite DeFi Hackathon with an 8-day sprint timeline, targeting $150,000+ in prize pools across 15+ blockchain networks.

## Product Vision

Create the first truly chain-abstracted wallet where users never think about which blockchain they're on. One balance, seamless transactions, magical user experience.

**Core Innovation: Chain Abstraction**

- Users see one USD balance across all supported chains
- When executing transactions, the wallet automatically bridges funds if needed
- Gas fees are handled transparently using optimal routes
- Cross-chain complexity is completely hidden from the user
